## My process
Firstly,i examined the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project.
After i was done examining the design i created the HTML structure of the project,i created a main container containing two containers and i added the necessary html content to each container in reference to the design.
Moving on to styling, i examined the style guide document to determine my fonts and colors and started appying the necessary styles to the body,maincontainer and the two containers. 
When i was done creating the layout i used media queries to adapt the layout to different screen sizes and that was how i successfully built this project.
Thank You!!!!

### I Built this project with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow




### What I learned
  I learnt more about css flexbox and i must add, i prefered using flexbox to grid in this project.
If you want more help with using flexbox, i recommend checking out Kevin Powell's youtube video regarding flexbox
